## Features

* ### Main Page
    1. Navbar - this consists of 2 elements. 
        * A clickable logo - Once clicked, it will direct you to back to the home page. On larger screens purposely set in the top left corner of the webpage as universally expected to be placed. On mobile screens the logo will take up the full width of a column at the head of the page, again to be easily accessible should a user want to return to a home page. The navbar is fixed to the top of the screen on all screen sizes again for ease of access.
        * An interactive menu - a border will appear when hovering over each section of the menu and will disappear when moved off it. This is designed to help guide the user to their intended page. On larger screens the menu will set in the top right hand of the page and on mobile devices will again take up a full width of a row to mimic a desktop menu experience.

    2. About us section. 
        * Hero image with a slogan - purposely placed is a simplified image of sunglasses on a beach to denote holidays.

    2. Contact information.

    3. Contact form. 
        * This page features a contact form to allow the user to send in a message by inputting their personal details. Each input box contains helpful text to guide as what information is needed. In the event the user ommits a field the form will prevent submission and direct to the field needing attention. The email input box also directs the user to insert the correct '@' sign in the event it is ommitted or forgotten. The 'submit' button also changes colour to advise the user it is being hovered over.
        ![Image of the contact form](documents/images/contact-form.JPG)
* ### Thank You Page
    1. Thank you message.
        * In keeping with consistency, once a user submits the contact form, they will be met with an acknowledgement page thanking them for their submission. This page includes the main websites navigation menu and footer to encourage familiarity. It also includes a direct instruction link to head back to the site. At present it does not contain a database to receive the users details from the form but will be added once the developers knowledge base exapnds therefore a fictational receipt is placed in the forms 'action' instead.
        ![Image of the thank you page](documents/images/thank-you-page.JPG)
* ### Future Features
    - Whilst currently not in the developers expertise, as knowledge will expand, the following features are to be included for the website;
        1. A carousel of holiday destinations in the hero image for sophistication.
        2. An integration in the footer and contact page whereby if a user clicks on the email and phone icon - it will enable them to directly phone out from their phone or send an email from the email app on mobile devices.
        3. A database to add to the current contact form action whereby it can store information using 'post' or 'get'  methods.

## Testing
***
* ### Testing user stories from user experience (UX).
    * #### Aim 1; "When I am on the website, I want to always be able to navigate across all pages easily."
        - Passed - A user will be able to click on each individual page using the navbar. This navigation bar always stays fixed to the top of the device screen for ease of access despite scrolling down the page. For example, if the user whilst halfway down the main page decides they want to now see deals, then they can quite simply click onto the deals page using the navbar. Likewise this applies even whilst being on different pages, the user choose to hover between pages. This is consistent and responsive on various media devices.
    ![Image of the navigation](documents/images/aim1.JPG)

    * #### Aim 2; "I want to be able to see a contact form for the organisation for booking enquiries."
        - Passed - A user can click on the contact page in the header and will see a contact form. Placeholder text guides a user as to what information is needed in each field. Once a user inputs all information they can click submit. The form will only work if all fields have data and in the event it doesn't, it will flag a 'required' message in the field data is ommitted. Once all fields have data, the user will recieve a 'thank you' message to confirm the form has been submitted and will guide back to the homepage. This test result is consistent across various media devices also.
        ![Image of contact form missing a field](documents/images/user-stories-2.JPG)
        ![Image of the thank you page](documents/images/thank-you-page.JPG)
    
    * #### Aim 3; "I want to be able to see previous customer reviews and any social media presence."
        - Passed - Users whilst being on the main page can scroll to the bottom and find (fictational) previous customer reviews with a heading of 'Here's what our customers say.' They are also able to see links in the footer which when clicked will guide them externally to our (fictational) social media platforms whilst still keeping our website tab open. This is consistent across other media devices also.
        ![Image of customer reviews and social media links from the footer](documents/images/reviews-and-social-media.JPG)

* ### Code validation.
    * #### W3 HTML Validator.
        * All HTML code was put through the validator and did initially bring up sytanx error. Those have since been corrected and now pass the validator with no errors.
    * #### Jigsaw CSS Validator.
        * All CSS code have been put through the validator - it did highlight a parse code whereby an open curly brace was evident in the media queries. This has since peen corrected and passed validation.
    * #### Lighthouse Testing.
        * Results.
            1. Main page results ![Lighthouse results of the main page](documents/images/lighthouse-main.JPG)

## Deployment
***
### Create the initial repository

* Add a template if needed and a repository name with an optional description
* click 'create' repository

### Gitpod
* The website was developed in Gitpod. Once the inital repository was created in Github and the workspace has been opened for the first time using the green gitpod button, thereafter the repository can be accessed from Gitpod by clicking on the 'dashboard' and finding the repo you need. Once you find the repo - you can click on the vertical 3 dots next to it and then 'open.'

* Once in the workspace in, directories were added using git command 'mkdir' and the directory name, files were added using 'touch' and the file name. Once content was added to the files, this was pushed to Github in the following steps using git commands;
    * 'git add (+ file name)' - for adding individual files or 'git add .' for adding several files
    * 'git status' can be used to check what files have been added
    * 'git commit -m (+ commit message)' will commit the files
    * 'git push' will push these files up to Github

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/).
2. At the top of the Repository, click on the 'settings' button.
3. Scroll down the Settings page until you find the "GitHub Pages" Section.
