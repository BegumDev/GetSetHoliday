## Testing
***
* ### Testing user stories from user experience (UX).
    * #### Aim 1;

    * #### Aim 2; "I want to be able to contact the organisation for booking enquiries."
    - Passed - A user can click on the contact page in the header and will see a contact form. Placeholder text guides a user as to what information is needed in each field. Once a user inputs all information they can click submit. The form will only work if all fields have data and in the event it doesn't, it will flag a 'required' message in the field data is ommitted. Once all fields have data, the user will recieve a 'thank you' message to confirm the form has been submitted and will guide back to the homepage. This test result is consistent across various media devices also.
